\section{The Paper's Methodology}
This paper tried to answer the question of how late could Population III stars
could still form using a series of numerical simulations.  The authors used 
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate a comoving volume of VOLUME 
Mpc$^3$.  This volume was filled with $2*256^3$ dark matter and baryonic 
particles ($256^3$ of each).  These particles had a mass
